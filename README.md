Project:- Portpofilo using html, css and javascript

A portfolio website is a personal or professional platform showcasing your work, skills, experience, and achievements. It is especially valuable for creatives, developers, designers, and freelancers who want to present their skills to potential employers or clients. Building a portfolio using HTML and CSS is an excellent way to show off your web development skills while giving you full control over the design and structure.

Key Components of a Portfolio Website
Homepage (Introduction/About Me):

HTML: Use this page to introduce yourself, giving a brief overview of who you are, your professional background, and what you do.
CSS: Apply a clean, professional design. Focus on typography, spacing, and layout. A hero section (large image or background) can be a nice touch.
Portfolio/Projects Page:

HTML: List your projects, each with a title, description, and a link to view more details. You can also include images or screenshots of your work.
CSS: Use grid or flexbox layouts to present the projects in an organized manner. Hover effects on project images or titles can make the page interactive and visually appealing.
Skills/Expertise Section:

HTML: Present your technical skills or services, possibly with icons, progress bars, or other visual indicators.
CSS: Use icons to represent different skills (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.). Color-coded progress bars or percentage-based indicators can highlight proficiency.
Resume/Experience Section:

HTML: Share your professional experience and education in a clean list format. You can also embed a downloadable PDF version of your resume.
CSS: A timeline format works well for showcasing work history and achievements. Styling the resume with proper headings, spacing, and fonts is important to maintain readability.
Contact Page:

HTML: Include a simple contact form (name, email, message) and links to your social media profiles or professional networks (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).
CSS: Focus on form layout and ensure it's responsive. Use clear buttons, labels, and validation error styling.
Navigation Bar:

HTML: A simple menu linking to different sections/pages of the portfolio.
CSS: Style it with a fixed, responsive design. It should collapse into a mobile-friendly format using a hamburger menu for smaller screens.
Footer:

HTML: The footer can include contact details, social media links, and copyright information.
CSS: Style it minimally, ensuring it's consistent with the overall theme of the portfolio.
Step-by-Step Guide to Building a Portfolio Website
HTML Structure:
Create a basic index.html file with sections for each part of your portfolio: header, main content, and footer.
Use semantic HTML elements like <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, and <footer> to organize your content properly.
